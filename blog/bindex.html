		<p><h2>My First Update</h2><br><h3><i>8/11/2018</i></h3><br>Welcome to the blog section, it's kind of boring now, and I am doing all of the formatting blind until I figure out how to do this in a better manner. In the mean time this is a decent way to have a little stream of updates beforee I actually figure this blog thing out. Still this is less expensive than designing a website with squarespace or a simillar service. I hope this works out and enjoy the future content.</p>

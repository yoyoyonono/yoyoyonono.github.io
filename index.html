		<p>So I have a website now, not sure what I am going to do with it, but it's here now. <br /> <a href="https://yoyoyonono.github.io/social.html">This</a> is my page with all of my social media stuff.<br> This is some of my other projects with 3d modeling and such, don't expect this to update too often. Click on the links to download the associated file. Be warned, the files might be quite large!</p>

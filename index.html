		<p>So I have a website now, not sure what I am going to do with it, but it's here now. <br /> <a href="https://yoyoyonono.github.io/social.html">This</a> is my page with all of my social media stuff.<br> This is some of my other projects with 3d modeling and such, don't expect this to update too often. Click on the links to download the associated file. Be warned, the files might be quite large!</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Miku, Meiko, Mario, and Len's slightly edited dance cover of GLIDE.<a href="http://yoyoyonono.github.io/videos/GLIDE.mp4"> view </a>
			<li> Miku, Len, Meiko, Rin, Neru, Luka and Kaito's also sligthly edited dance cover of DOPE. I will reupload once I get access to my laptop on which the video is stored.
		</ul>
		<p>I also am trying to write a blog now, it has no particular topic, I'll just be writing about whatever I think is interesting. Click <a href = "http://yoyoyonono.github.io/blog/bindex.html">here</a> to go to it. <br /> I also forked shoof-shoof-revolution and hosted it on my own github page. Find it <a href="https://yoyoyonono.github.io/shoof-shoof-revolution/">here.</a</p>

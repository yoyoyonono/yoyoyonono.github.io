		<p>So I have a website now, not sure what I am going to do with it, but it's here now. <br /> I am planning to have the links to all of my social media pages  here as well as on NameMC. Click <a href="https://mine.ly/TheMinecraftTDM.1">here</a> to go to my NameMC page until I do that. I also have a page on MAL, click <a href="https://myanimelist.net/profile/Yoyoyonono">here</a><br> This is some of my other projects with 3d modeling and such, don't expect this to update too often. Click on the links to download the associated file. Be warned, the files might be quite large!</p>

		<p>So I have a website now, not sure what I am going to do with it, but it's here now. <br /> <a href="https://yoyoyonono.github.io/social.html">This</a> is my page with all of my social media stuff.<br> <a 
href="https://yoyoyonono.github.io/3d.html">This</a> is whatever links I have to my 3d modeling stuff.</p>
		<p>I also am trying to write a blog now, it has no particular topic, I'll just be writing about whatever I think is interesting. Click <a href = "http://yoyoyonono.github.io/blog/bindex.html">here</a> to go to it. <br /> I also forked shoof-shoof-revolution and hosted it on my own github page. Find it <a href="https://yoyoyonono.github.io/shoof-shoof-revolution/">here.</a</p>
